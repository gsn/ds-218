				<p>Chrishon Lampley’s interest in culture, fine arts and wine, and upscale fashion was shaped by her experiences in working and living in Chicago, Germany, New York, and Las Vegas. As an entrepreneur, sales broker, vintner, and wine enthusiast, Chrishon has had her pulse on many of the cultural and social trends in the market for the past 20 years. In December 2013, entrepreneur Chrishon Lampley transitioned from being the owner of a winebar and art gallery to the proprietor of the lifestyle brand and wine company – Love Cork Screw. During this time, Chrishon and her team introduced six varietals to the Chicago Metro Area and within a matter of months Love Cork Screw Wines was available in several locations. As a lifestyle brand, Love Cork Screw wine has a home in various fine dining establishments, bars, major chain stores and liquor stores in the Chicago metropolitan area. Additionally, Love Cork Screw has expanded its brand beyond wine to include Lampley Cigars and Love Cork Screw Scented Candles.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>One of the biggest accomplishments for Chrishon Lampley and the Love Cork Screw brand is the philanthropic work that is also a part of the company’s mission. Since its inception, Love Cork Screw has committed to inspiring young women and men to become tomorrow’s entrepreneurs.
